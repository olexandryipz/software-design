When I die, then bury me  
In my beloved Ukraine,  
In the wide steppe’s open grave  
Amid the spreading plain —  
So I may see the fields, the hills,  
And feel the Dnipro’s roar.

When it flows down from Ukraine  
Into the deep blue sea —  
Maybe then I'll leave these hills  
And soar away to God...

If my foes would find my grave,  
They would trample my body underfoot,  
But oh, my soul will rise up  
And seek revenge for my blood.

And when my spirit wanders free,  
I will call upon my people:  
Arise, my brethren, rise and fight  
For your land, your freedom, your rights!
